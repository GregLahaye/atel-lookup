We present the results of preliminary spectral fits to the first 130  
ksec INTEGRAL ToO observation of GX 339-4 (see ATel #980, #986),   
obtained between 2007, Jan 30, 15:56 and Feb 01, 06:11.    
We made joint spectral fits to spectra obtained with  
the JEM-X (5-20 keV) and IBIS/ISGRI (23-300 keV) instruments.  
  
The model that best phenomenologically fits the joint spectrum consists of an absorbed  
multi-color black-body disk plus a powerlaw with a high-energy cut-off  
at 22 +/- 5 keV and a folding energy of 68 +/- 5 keV.  The presence of  
curvature between 20-30 keV and line-like residuals revealed between  
6-8 keV, is likely due to disk reflection.  We will explore fits with  
reflection models in future work.  
  
The presence of the radiation coming from the disk is significant, and  
we find a color temperature of the inner disk of T = 1.5 +/- 0.1 keV.  
The powerlaw has a photon index of 1.67 +/- 0.07.  These parameters are   
broadly consistent with rising hard states. The implied luminosity of the   
source in the 5-300 keV band was L = 1.3-1.7 E+38 erg/s, calculated taking into account a  
distance to the source of 8.5 kpc.  
  
We examined the JEM-X and IBIS/ISGRI light curves with a time binning of 1000 sec,  
in the 3-6, 6-10, 10-15, 15-35, 20-40, 40-60, 60-100, 100-200 keV  
energy ranges. The source was slowly increasing its brightness since the  
beginning of the observation in the overall energy range of 3-200 keV.
